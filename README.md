# DBMS_CosmoFlix11_Streaming_platform_database

This is the database management project done by group of 4 students of Dhirubhai Ambani University, Gandhinagar. 
We have designed and integrated a comprehensive database management system of an online streaming platform which
we have named 'CosmoFlix11'. 
We have implemented it from the scratch, starting from base idea, entity-relationship diagram, relational schema 
to final database, user defined functions and triggers.
PostgreSQL and PL/pgSQL is used to implement this entire backend of the database.

Our database provides the content to users, handles subscriptions, process the data and updates the analytics, 
calculates the demographics, handles Advertisment streaming and demographics, serves useful information to companies 
about reviews of their streaming item.
